Vim configuration with support for Rspec, Rails 3, RVM and Git.

Vim must be run from within a tmux session to run specs asynchronously.

## Requirements

Vim 7.3 or better
Tested on MacOS and Linux

Introduction to Vim: http://blog.interlinked.org/tutorials/vim_tutorial.html

## Quick Install

    curl https://raw.github.com/krisleech/turbo-vim/master/bootstrap.sh -o - | sh

## Basic Mappings

The leader is mapped to `,`

### In Normal mode (`Esc` or `jj`)

`,p`     - File browser (NerdTree)

`,f`     - Find in Files (Ctrlp)

`Space`  - Search in buffer

`,a`     - Search in files

`,d`     - close buffer

`,D`     - close all buffers

`,Space` - Remove search highlighting

`//`     - Toggle comments (T-Comment)

`Tab`    - Next buffer

`Shift + Tab` - Previous buffer

`,,`     - Toggle between last two buffers

`,m`     - Jump to model

`,v`     - Jump to view

`,c`     - Jump to controller

`,rt`    - Generate tags for project and gems

### In Insert mode (`i`)

`jj` - Back to normal mode

`<tab>` - auto complete or expand snippet

See `.vimrc` for more.

## Plugins

### rails

*Lots* of stuff - get to know this plugin!

`:A` - jump to/from test

`:Rmodel` - jump to model

`:Rview` - jump to view

`:help rails`

### Turbux + Vimux (,t / ,T / ,tt)

`,t` - run all tests for current buffer

`,T` - run test for current line

`,tt` - run all tests

Runs specs in a tmux pane. Vim must be running in a tmux session for this to
work. If you already have the tmux window split it will send the command to run
the spec to that pane. Otherwise a new pane is created.

### ZoomWin (,z)

Zoom the current window if you have multiple splits.

Press `,z` again to toogle back to normal.

### ruby-block

Provides text-objects for Ruby blocks

`var` (visual around Ruby)

`vir` (visual inner Ruby)

`ar` / `ir` (expand/contract selection)

`cir` (change inner Ruby)

`dar` (delete around Ruby)

http://vimcasts.org/blog/2010/12/a-text-object-for-ruby-blocks/

### fugitive

Git integration

*Lots* of stuff

`:Gstatus` and press `-` to stage file

`:Gcommit` to commit changes

http://vimcasts.org/episodes/fugitive-vim---a-complement-to-command-line-git/

`:help fugitive`

### Ctrlp (,f)

Find files in your project with minimal keypresses

Search is fuzzy so `conadus` would find `controllers/admin/users`

`,f path_or_filename`

`Esc` - cancel

### tcomment (`//`)

Comment/Uncomment line

### yankring

Shows history of yanked (copied) text

After pasting (`p`) pressing `ctrl + p` will cycle through paste history

### ag (`,a`)

Search project for text (aka find in files)

`,a word`

`,a "some words"`

If you prefer you can also do `:Ack` to use ack.

### nerdtree (`,p`)             

Project file browser

`,p` opens file browser

`o` / `x` open and close files/folders

`m` menu to move/delete/copy files/folders

`?` Help

I use nerdtree for creating or moving files, but find CtrlP (`,p`) quicker for
opening files.

### surround (`ys`/`cs`/`ds`)

Allows adding/removing/changing of surroundings

I would highly recommend getting to know this plugin, it is very useful.
Especially when you grok text objects.

*Characters*

`ysiw)`    - surround inner word with `()`

`ysiw(`    - surround inner word with `(  )`

In the above example `iw` can be replaced with any text object or motion.

If you find yourself manually adding surroundings, stop and work out the
correct text object or motion.

`cs"'`     - change surrounding from `"` to `'`

`ds`       - delete surrounding

*HTML tags*

`yss<p>`  - surround line in `<p>` tags

`cst<div>` - change surround tag to `<div>`

### colorschemes

Lots of colourschemes, I like Solarized and desert-warm-256

`:set colorscheme desert-warm-256`

`:set background=dark`

`:set background=light`

### fuzzyfinder (`,b`)

Find open buffer by path/filename

### vundle

Plugin manager and part of the reason why my vimfiles as so compact

## INSTALLATION

Note: If you are using RVM make sure you use system ruby before installation.
    
    rvm use system

Note: If you already have Vim installed ensure it has support for Ruby:

    vim --version | grep ruby

You should see `+ruby,` if you see `-ruby` you need to reinstall Vim with Ruby support

### Install Vim (if not already installed)

#### MacOS: MacVim / Vim 

    brew install macvim --override-system-vim --enable-clipboard

Add `/usr/local/bin` before `/usr/bin` in your `$PATH` so you use the version of
vim installed by Homebrew, not the one that comes with MacOS.

By installing Vim in this way MacVim and regular Vim are exactly the same.

#### Ubuntu: gVim / Vim

*Server*

    apt-get install vim-nox

*Desktop*

    apt-get install vim-gnome

#### GNU/Linux from source

If you have an old GNU/Linux distro which does not have Vim 7.3 or better in its repos then install from source.

The configure options below leave out any GUI related features as I have only compiled Vim on a server.

Vim source is in a hg (Mercurial) repository so you need to install the hg
client first, e.g.  `sudo apt-get install mercurial`.

    hg clone https://vim.googlecode.com/hg/ vim
    cd vim/vim73
    ./configure
    ./configure --with-features=huge --enable-cscope --enable-pythoninterp --enable-rubyinterp --enable-perlinterp --enable-multibyte
    make
    sudo make install

This installs Vim to `/usr/local/bin,` check this is in your `$PATH` before `/usr/bin` which may contain an older system version of Vim.

If you get an error `no terminal library found` install `libncurses5-dev`.

### Install these vimfiles

Note: You will already have a `~/.vim` folder, either delete or move it.

    mv ~/.vim ~/.vim.old
    git clone https://github.com/krisleech/vimfiles ~/.vim
    cd ~/.vim
    rake install

or run:

    curl https://raw.github.com/krisleech/vimfiles/master/bootstrap.sh -o - | sh

#### To update to the latest vimfiles

    cd ~/.vim
    rake update

#### Install Dependacies

*MacOS*

    brew install ack (ag is a better ack)
    brew install ag
    brew install ctags

Note: MacOS comes with the BSD version of ctags which is not compatible.

*Ubuntu*

    sudo apt-get install exuberant-ctags
    sudo apt-get install the-silver-searcher (ag is a better ack)
    sudo apt-get install ack-grep
    sudo ln -s /usr/bin/ack-grep /usr/local/bin/ack
